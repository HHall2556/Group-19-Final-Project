Project Clean Air
Members: Jon Lair, Asa Dixon, Henry Hall, Saad Mahmoud El Refai


Source and dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution 

This data set pulls from the EPA database regarding pollution in the US states, from four of the major pollutants: Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, and Ozone. The data is pulled during the time period of 2000 - 2016. The data is organized by states, counties, type of pollution, and amount of pollution.

Project Clean Air is for the general public, as well as volunteer groups and agencies, but also all encompassing for anyone who's concerned with their local air quality, and the potential impacts that pollution can have on their health. Project Clean Air will help visualize and bring awareness to the issue of pollution, as well as direct people to support options. Knowledge is power, and with more awareness of this critical issue it will help spread motivation to address the issue. The major features would include a region search to see specific areas of the US and the amount of pollution in those areas, as well as a local search to see the pollution levels of the customer's area. Additionally the product will allow the customer to see the change in pollution over time in those areas, and how they can contribute to helping solve the problem.
